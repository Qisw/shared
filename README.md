# Readme #

This repo contains code written by [Lutz Hendricks](http://www.lhendricks.org).

Some of the code is directly related to economics (production functions, utility functions, etc.).

Other code is general purpose (writing Latex tables, finding files, matrix and vector manipulation, etc.).

In posting this code, I hope to make a small contribution towards reducing the amount of time researchers spend on [duplicating the work of others](http://www.lhendricks.org/duplication.html).

For a table of contents with brief descriptions, see the [test routine](test_allLH.m).

Comments are welcome.
